# FACIAL RECOGNITION ATTENDANCE SYSTEM USING MATLAB

We have captured the images of the persons through the data collection code after we created seperate folders for each person in our group.


This project is a Facial Recognition Attendance System using MATLAB that automates the process of marking attendance by capturing student images through a webcam, detecting and recognizing faces using a pretrained deep learning network, and comparing them with a stored database. Recognized students are automatically marked as present in an Excel sheet along with the date, time, and location, while unregistered faces are labeled as “Unknown,” making the system efficient, reliable, and secure compared to traditional manual methods.
